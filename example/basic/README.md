Basic Demo
=============

## Deployment
Assuming you have Java 8, Maven and Git installed, you can build and run the latest version of the road traffic demo by doing the following:

```bash
# Clone the Gaffer repository, to reduce the amount you need to download this will only clone the master branch with a depth of 1 so there won't be any history.
git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer.git
cd Gaffer

# This will download several maven dependencies such as tomcat.
# Using -pl we tell maven only to build the demo module and just download the other Gaffer binaries from maven.
# The -Pbasic-demo is a profile that will automatically startup a standalone instance of tomcat with the REST API and UI deployed.
mvn install -Pquick -Pbasic-demo -pl example/basic/basic-rest
```

If you wish to build all of Gaffer first then just remove the "-pl example/basic/basic-rest" part.

The rest api will be deployed to localhost:8080/rest.
